# UP_Robot_Arm

This is the 6 axis robot arm project we are designing for Lonestar UP campus Robotics Club.

# Progress

## Design
We have designed and printed the first 4 axis of the arm in Fusion. The assembly of these is complete, but we have not mounted motor 4.

## Code
We have successfully controlled the first axis from a joystic using the Teensy 4.1.

## Odrive
Motor parameters are working but could be fine-tuned more. We are using high-speed torque motors, and I believe they are the cause of the issues, but with the gear reduction, it should work fine.
